<h1>üì¶ Serverless Inventory Tracking System on AWS</h1>

This project demonstrates how to **implement a fully serverless architecture on AWS** for an **inventory-tracking system** without using Amazon EC2, enabling automatic scaling and efficient pay-per-use operations.

---

<h1>üöÄ Project Overview</h2>

Stores worldwide upload inventory files to Amazon S3, triggering a serverless workflow:
‚úÖ **AWS Lambda** processes uploaded files and updates **Amazon DynamoDB** with inventory data.  
‚úÖ Another Lambda function monitors DynamoDB updates and triggers **Amazon SNS** notifications when inventory is out of stock.  
‚úÖ A **Cognito-authenticated web dashboard** displays current inventory levels by querying DynamoDB directly.

---

**Your architecture will look like the following example:**

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Services Used</h2>

- Amazon S3 ‚Äì Stores uploaded inventory files.
- AWS Lambda ‚Äì Executes backend logic on demand.
- Amazon DynamoDB ‚Äì Stores and manages inventory data.
- Amazon SNS ‚Äì Sends email/SMS notifications for low inventory.
- Amazon Cognito ‚Äì Manages user authentication for dashboard access.
- AWS IAM ‚Äì Manages secure permissions.

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Workflow</h2>

1Ô∏è‚É£ Store uploads inventory file (CSV/JSON) to S3.
2Ô∏è‚É£ S3 triggers Lambda #1:
Parses the file.
Inserts/updates records in DynamoDB.
3Ô∏è‚É£ DynamoDB Streams trigger Lambda #2:
Checks inventory levels.
Publishes to SNS if inventory is out of stock.
4Ô∏è‚É£ SNS sends notifications via email/SMS to stakeholders.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Cognito-authenticated users log into a web dashboard to view live inventory data directly from DynamoDB.

<h2>üöÄ Deployment Steps</h2>

‚úÖ 1. Creating a Lambda function to load data.
- On the AWS Management Console, in the search box, enter and choose Lambda to open the Lambda console.
- Choose Create function.
- Configure the following settings:
For Function name, enter **Load-Inventory**.
For Runtime, choose **Python 3.8**.
Expand  Change default execution role, and configure the following options:
For Execution role, choose create new role. This role gives the Lambda function permission to access Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.
- Choose Create function.
- In the Code source section, in the Environment pane, choose lambda_function.py.
- In the code editor for the lambda_function.py file, delete all the default code.
- In the Code source editor, copy and paste the following code:
